============

This repository contain a compendium of data (/data), source code (/src) and figures (/fig) reproduced from the publication: L.S.Premo, 2004, Local spatial autocorrelation statistics quantify multi-scale patterns in distributional data: an example from the Maya Lowlands, Journal of Archaeological Science 31, 855-866 (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2003.12.002).

> Site coordinates have been included in this report in hopes that interested researchers will take this opportunity to experiment with the local spatial autocorrelation analysis

> Despite the fact that local spatial statistics display a unique potential to investigate location-based hypotheses, few tools exist for applying them to archaeological data. Fortunately, Sawada[15] has provided a Visual Basic for Applications add-in for Excel, called Rookcase

The present analysis makes exclusive use of R to reproduce Premo's research.
